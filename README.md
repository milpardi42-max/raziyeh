# Rosie Atelier

Premium bilingual (فارسی RTL / English LTR) platform for **patterns · creators · portfolios · products · education**.

Built with Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind v4 and a token-driven design system.
Repository: [`milpardi42-max/raziye1`](https://github.com/milpardi42-max/raziye1) · Node.js SSR application.

> **Iran / no-VPN availability:** this code serves bundled and uploaded media from the site's own domain, but it cannot choose your hosting country, DNS route, or ISP reachability. For reliable access inside Iran, deploy the app and persistent media storage on an Iran-reachable provider and test on Iranian mobile/fixed networks. See [MEDIA-DELIVERY-IR.md](MEDIA-DELIVERY-IR.md).

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000 → redirects to /fa (or /en)
npm run check    # typecheck + lint
npm run build && npm start
```

`npm run dev` auto-detects WebContainer environments (StackBlitz, Bolt.new) and applies the async-context mitigation required by Next.js 15.5.x there — see [STACKBLITZ.md](STACKBLITZ.md). Ordinary machines run plain `next dev` with no changes.

## StackBlitz preview

[Open the updated source branch in StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/milpardi42-max/rozalit/tree/arena/01a0e3c7-rozalit)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:stackblitz
# Second terminal, while the server is running:
npm run smoke:stackblitz
```

The repository includes the source implementation, not just a downloadable archive.
See [STACKBLITZ.md](STACKBLITZ.md) for cache cleanup, diagnostics, and the limits of the
opt-in WebContainer async-context mitigation. It has been tested in Node.js; actual
StackBlitz validation is still required. Normal production execution is unchanged.

## Live / Deploy

**GitHub repo:** https://github.com/milpardi42-max/raziye1

### One-click deploy

Netlify and Vercel deployments are convenient for international access, but are **not a guarantee of reachability from Iran**. For the no-VPN requirement, use an Iran-reachable Node host and storage endpoint, and verify them from Iranian networks before launch.

| Platform | Button |
| --- | --- |
| **Netlify** | [![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/milpardi42-max/raziye1) |
| **Vercel** | [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/milpardi42-max/raziye1) |

After import, set environment variables (see `.env.example`):

- `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `AUTH_SECRET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` = your public URL (no trailing slash)
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` for persistent admin content
- For persistent uploaded photos/videos, configure the `MARKETPLACE_S3_*` variables for an S3-compatible object store reachable from the app server; uploaded media is then streamed through your own `/api/media` domain.

Then open `https://<your-site>/api/health` — expect `"ok": true`.

### Local production

```bash
npm ci && npm run build && npm start
# → http://localhost:3000/fa
```

`npm run build` also runs `postbuild` (`scripts/sync-standalone.mjs`), which copies `public/`
and `dist/.next/static/` into `dist/.next/standalone/` — `next build` does not do that itself, and
without it the standalone server answers HTML while every stylesheet, script and image 404s.

To run the standalone bundle instead of `next start`:

```bash
npm run build
ADMIN_EMAIL=… ADMIN_PASSWORD=… AUTH_SECRET=… PORT=3000 HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 \
  node dist/.next/standalone/server.js      # it chdirs into dist/.next/standalone itself
```

If you ever build and then move things by hand, re-run `node scripts/sync-standalone.mjs` before
starting the server.

#### Runtime data and builds

The store writes JSON and master files into `data/` relative to the working directory, so the
standalone server owns `dist/.next/standalone/data`. `next build` bundles the repository copy of
`data/*.json` (and `data/objects/**`) into that same folder — without protection, every deploy
would overwrite live uploads, orders, licences and reservations with the committed snapshot.
`scripts/preserve-data.mjs` fixes that: `prebuild` snapshots the running store to
`.runtime-data/`, `postbuild` restores it verbatim. To re-seed the running store from `data/` on
purpose, build with `ROZVELT_DATA_FROM_REPO=1`.

## Design system

- **Tokens** in `globals.css`: `--background` (white), `--surface`, `--foreground`, `--primary` (slate),
  `--accent` (copper), `--blue`, shadows (soft/medium/elevated/glow), radii, motion.
- **Dark mode**: `html[data-theme="dark"]` — a real deep/cinematic theme, toggled in header/footer.
- **Typography**: `font-display` (Instrument Serif) for Latin editorial headlines; **all Persian text
  resolves to `iransanse-web`** via `html[lang=fa]` rules; scale utilities `text-display … text-label`.
- **Motion**: `anim-blur-in`, `anim-fade-up`, `anim-scale-fade`, `[data-reveal]` scroll reveal,
  `img-zoom`, `arrow-shift`, `.spotlight` — all respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **RTL/LTR**: logical properties only (`ms/me/ps/pe/start/end/inset-inline`), `rtl-flip` for icons.

## Digital marketplace

The digital licensing storefront (private master upload → admin review → payment → signed download →
PDF certificate → royalties → subscriptions) is documented in **[`MARKETPLACE.md`](./MARKETPLACE.md)** —
including the audit, every new route, the env flags and a step-by-step test recipe.
Without `ZARINPAL_MERCHANT_ID` the built-in sandbox gateway takes over, so a full test purchase works
end-to-end today.

## The shop hero

The shop's hero (`src/components/shop/ShopHero.tsx`, rendered by `/{locale}/shop`) is one section in
four movements — and the only part of the shop that is custom; the catalogue below it (family
sections, sidebar tree, filters, sorting) is `ShopFiltered`, unchanged:

1. **the boutique panel** — a dark editorial card: the shop eyebrow, the collection's title and copy,
   and the two doors into the catalogue (`/shop?owner=site` · `/shop?owner=artist`);
2. **live numbers** taken from the real catalogue, not typed by hand: products · families in use
   (e.g. `4/8`) · colourways · contributing designers;
3. **the product mosaic** — the lead site-owned featured piece (family · maker · SKU · price), a
   second piece, and the lead's colourways with their swatch tiles, instead of a single flat image;
4. **the family rail** — all eight families of `lib/data/families.ts` as `?family=<slug>` chips with
   their counts, beside the service note from the shop banner.

`scripts/marketplace-smoke/shop-hero-e2e.sh` pins it down in both locales: the panel and its two
CTAs, the four numbers **recomputed from the store the server is using** (`DATA=…`), the mosaic
(lead link, badge, SKU, family, second piece, colourway names and images), all eight family links
with their real counts, and that the catalogue below (family sections, result counter, `?family=`
isolation) still behaves.

## Product taxonomy (families)

Products belong to one of eight families, defined once in `src/lib/data/families.ts` and stored on
`Product.familyId` (and, for marketplace uploads, on `UploadSession.meta.familyId` → `Asset.familyId`):

کاغذ دیواری · پارچه دکوراسیون داخلی · پرده · کوسن · روتختی · رومیزی · پارچه مبلمان · آثار هنری دیواری
(Wallpaper · Home Fabric · Curtain · Cushion · Bedding · Tablecloth · Upholstery Fabric · Wall Art)

- **Shop** — `/{locale}/shop` renders one section per family in that order (plus «سایر محصولات /
  Other products» for products without a family) and `?family=<slug>` filters to a single family;
  `?family` composes with `?category`, `?artist`, sorting and search. Style categories are unchanged.
- **Sidebar** — the families appear as nested sub-categories under «الگو / Pattern», above the style
  categories, with live counts.
- **Artist upload** — the uploader in the artist profile requires a family; the session API answers
  `invalid_family` otherwise. After a successful upload the artist is redirected to that family in the
  shop (`/{locale}/shop?family=<slug>`), and `/artist` shows the family next to each asset.
- **Admin** — `ProductsManager` gives every product a «دسته محصول» selector (including «بدون دسته»).

## Artists: registration & dashboard

Registration is the two doors the site always had, each with its own form:

- `/{locale}/signup` — **the registration form**: it carries the account-type choice itself
  («خریدار» / «هنرمند / طراح», radios named `account_role`) next to the four account fields (name,
  e-mail, password, confirmation) — pick the artist half and the account is created as an artist. The
  shell then hands the new account over to the login transition.
- `/{locale}/creators/join` — **designers / sellers**: the signup page with the perks, the designers
  already on board and its own single-page seller form (name, e-mail, phone, field of practice, city,
  Instagram, portfolio and the password pair). Only the four account fields are required; the rest is
  optional and can be completed later from the artist dashboard. `POST /api/auth/signup` creates the
  account, stores what was given on the `Artist` record (`signupPhone`, `signupCity`,
  `signupSpecialty`, `signupPortfolioUrl`, the Instagram handle and the portfolio link), signs the
  designer in and sends the file to admin review as `pending`. Together the two doors cover both
  kinds of account: the quick one for buyers (and for designers who want to fill the file in later) and
  the full seller application for designers.

The artist area:

- `/{locale}/artist` — **artist dashboard** (server-rendered): identity + status, onboarding ribbon,
  KPIs with 30-day trend arrows, work status, wallet & payout summary, delivery-at-a-glance
  (colourways · files · total size · format spread), "make it sell better" hints (missing recommended
  formats, single-colour works, missing previews), every work with its colour swatches and format
  chips, latest ledger rows and the sales mix. Quick actions deep-link into the studio tabs.
- `/{locale}/artist/marketplace` — the sales studio (`?tab=assets|upload|wallet|analytics|affiliate`).
- `/{locale}/artist/portfolio` — the portfolio manager (patterns, products, profile, stats).
- `/{locale}/account` — **the designer's own profile page is the dashboard**: an artist (or any account
  with an artist profile) gets `ArtistDashboardPanel` — the very same server-rendered dashboard, with
  none of the buyer sections (no overview, reservations, orders or settings, no account banner). Both
  routes render byte-for-byte the same content. **Buyers** keep their account view untouched.
- Signed-out visitors are redirected to login; a signed-in **buyer** is shown an honest upsell to the
  designer registration instead of a form they cannot use (the artist APIs still enforce the role).

## The portfolio page & the founder's introduction

`/{locale}/portfolio` is the atelier's gallery — and it now opens with a **complete, dedicated
introduction of راضیه خیری‌پور**, the founder. The page reads:

1. the page hero (breadcrumb, «گالری پروژه‌های اجراشده») as before;
2. **the introduction** — portrait/atelier image, the eyebrow «معرفی بنیان‌گذار», the name, her
   standing and her fields, the full five-paragraph biography, the discipline chips, the signature,
   then the four key numbers (years of practice · patterns · exhibitions · students);
3. **the path and the facts** — «مسیر حرفه‌ای» with its four milestones (2009 · teaching · 2023 ·
   today) beside «در یک نگاه» (academic role, field of work, based in, languages) and the card that
   leads to her personal portfolio;
4. **the works** — the «آثار منتخب و پروژه‌های اجراشده» heading, the statistics bar, the filter bar
   and the masonry grid of the six realised projects (untouched);
5. **the closing band** — how to collaborate: contact, academy, the studio and the designer entry.

All of the copy lives in `src/lib/razieh-profile.ts` (bilingual `fa` / `en`) and is rendered by
`src/components/portfolio/PortfolioIntro.tsx` on the server, so every line of the introduction is in
the first HTML response.

The two portfolio surfaces are now one experience: the introduction links to **`/{locale}/razieh`**,
the founder's own portfolio page (hero · about · works · philosophy · academic · contact, with its own
language switch), which links back to the atelier's gallery in its hero menu. `/razieh` is also
listed in the footer and in `sitemap.xml`, so it is no longer an orphan page.

The rig for all of this is `scripts/marketplace-smoke/portfolio-e2e.sh` (78 checks across both
locales): the introduction is complete and sits above the works, the gallery keeps its six projects,
the two pages point at each other, and the footer/sitemap entries exist.

## Signing out

`SignOutButton` (`src/components/profile/SignOutButton.tsx`) is the single sign-out control, in four
variants (`solid` / `outline` / `ghost` / `menu` + an icon-only form). It is offered everywhere a
signed-in visitor can be:

| Where | How it appears |
|---|---|
| Header | avatar opens an account menu (account, licenses, artist dashboard, sales studio) ending with «خروج از حساب» |
| Header (mobile) | the menu shows the signed-in account card with a sign-out button |
| `/account` | profile header button, a row at the end of the sidebar menu, and a dedicated row in **Settings** |
| `/account/licenses` | same header shell |
| `/artist`, `/artist/marketplace`, `/artist/portfolio` | button next to the page actions |

Clicking it clears the session cookie, **replaces** the history entry (so Back cannot return to a
private page) and refreshes the router, so every server component re-renders as a guest.

Data for the dashboard comes from `src/lib/artist/dashboard.ts` (artist record + works with delivery
detail + analytics with a previous-period comparison + wallet), so the page itself is a pure view.

## Academy

The academy homepage (hero preview video, real computed statistics, real enrolment form) and the
navigation change (آکادمی · هنرمندان · پورتفولیو · فروشگاه) are documented in
**[`ACADEMY.md`](./ACADEMY.md)** — including how the preview video is generated
(`scripts/academy/make-preview-video.py`), how an admin can replace it by uploading a video for a
course, and the enrolment smoke check (`scripts/academy/enroll-e2e.sh`).

## Admin

Sign in at `/{locale}/login` with the admin account → `/{locale}/admin`.
Manage: homepage sections (order/visibility), hero, categories/styles, pattern/product/artist/
portfolio/education flags & ordering, banners, SEO. Every save is live immediately (all pages are dynamic).

- **Auth**: server-side, HMAC-signed HttpOnly cookie (`src/lib/auth.ts`, `/api/auth/*`), with a small
  per-IP+email login throttle (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`) to blunt brute-force attempts.
  - Production: set `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `AUTH_SECRET`.
  - Local dev without env vars: any `admin@…` email + ≥4-char password.
  - **Never cached**: `/api/auth/*` and `/api/admin/content` answer with `cache-control: private,
    no-store` + `netlify-cdn-cache-control: no-store` (`src/lib/http.ts`), and the browser sends them
    with `credentials: "same-origin"`. A replayed stale `/api/auth/me` would report "logged out"
    right after login and bounce the admin back to `/login`. `AppProviders` additionally guards the
    session with a version counter (`sessionVersionRef`): a `/me` answer that is older than the
    `login()`/`logout()` that raced it is dropped instead of overwriting the fresh session.
- **Storage** (`src/lib/data/store.ts`, first configured wins):
  1. Upstash Redis — `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`  ← **required on Netlify**
  2. Vercel Blob — `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (practical on Vercel only)
  3. Local file — `data/content.json` (dev / VPS / Docker volume; **read-only on serverless**)

  If a save fails on a read-only filesystem the API answers `502 storage_write_failed` with the
  reason in the log — check `GET /api/health`, which reports the active backend.
- **Images and videos:** new artist/admin media is saved to the S3-compatible object store configured
  by `MARKETPLACE_S3_*` and served from `/api/media/<id>` on the app's own domain. Without S3, the
  app uses `data/objects`; that directory must be a writable, persistent disk/volume. On serverless
  platforms, configure S3 before enabling uploads.

## Deploy (Netlify — recommended)

This app is **server-rendered**: it uses middleware, route handlers (`/api/*`), a signed-cookie admin
session and admin-managed runtime content. Every page is `force-dynamic`.

1. **app.netlify.com → Add new site → Import an existing project → GitHub** → `milanopardi13/artikel` (branch `main`).
2. The `netlify.toml` in this repo configures everything (build command, `.next` publish,
   `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`, Node 20, security headers). Leave build settings as-is.
3. **Site configuration → Environment variables** — add:
   | Variable | Required? | Purpose |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `ADMIN_EMAIL` | yes (prod) | admin login user |
   | `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | yes (prod) | admin login password |
   | `AUTH_SECRET` | strongly recommended | cookie signing key (long random string) |
   | `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | yes | persistent admin content (serverless FS is read-only) |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | yes | canonical URL for `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, OG tags |
   See `.env.example` for details. **Redeploy after adding env vars** (env changes alone do not rebuild).
4. Verify: open `https://<site>/api/health` — expect `"persistent": true` and `"configured": true`.
5. Optional: **Domains** → connect your own domain.

Every push to the production branch rebuilds and redeploys automatically (~2–3 min). Preview deploys
are created for pushes on other branches.

### ⚠️ Not deployable to GitHub Pages / static hosting

The app **cannot** run as a static export: `output: "export"` fails the build because
`/api/*` route handlers use `force-dynamic` and middleware isn't supported in export mode.
Do not add a "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow to this repo — it will always fail.
Host it on a Node-capable platform (Netlify, Vercel, VPS, Docker, Liara…).

### Deploy (Vercel)

Import the same repo at **vercel.com/new** (framework auto-detected), set the same env vars, and
for persistent admin content attach **Storage → Upstash Redis** (or Vercel **Blob** — the code talks
to both over plain REST) → **Redeploy**. `vercel.json` pins the region to `fra1`; change it if your
audience is elsewhere.

### Other hosts (VPS / Docker / Liara / etc.)

`npm ci && npm run build && npm start` on Node 20+. Set the same env vars; without Redis/Blob, content persists
to `data/content.json` — keep that directory on a persistent volume.

## Performance notes

- All page payloads render on demand; images use `next/image` with explicit `sizes`.
- The global search palette does **not** receive the full catalog via props anymore — it lazily
  fetches `/api/search-index` (public, cacheable 5 min, locale-agnostic) on first use and warms it
  during browser idle time. This keeps the catalog listing out of every page's RSC payload.
- `sitemap.xml` / `robots.txt` are generated and revalidated hourly so new admin slugs appear
  without a redeploy.
